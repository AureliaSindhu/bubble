# Bubble Sort in Assembly (LC-3)

A program that implements bubble sort algorithm in LC-3 assembly language. The program takes 8 numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order.

## Usage

1. Load the program into the LC-3 simulator
2. Enter 8 numbers when prompted (numbers must be between -32768 and 32767)
3. The program will display the sorted numbers in ascending order
4. The original array will be preserved in memory starting at x3100

## Features

- Implements classic bubble sort algorithm in LC-3 assembly
- Handles both positive and negative 16-bit integers
- Memory efficient implementation
- Input validation included
- Clear output formatting
